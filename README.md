# nuclear-decay-rates
Construction (DONE) and analysis (TODO) of the nuclear decay network using the NUBASE2020 data set.

If you're looking for the current state of this project, [go to this link](https://github.com/Rachmanin0xFF/nuclear-decay-rates/blob/main/Nuclear%20WIP%20Presentation.pdf) for some slides I made.
